Ashravan adjusted the unfamiliar weight of the regalia. The Emperor's favor, once revoked, now shone brighter than ever, thanks to the Forger. But the restoration... it felt incomplete. A phantom echo of Shai's touch lingered, a subtle dissonance in his soul.

He was summoned to the Sunlit Courts, the same halls where his disgrace had unfolded. Courtiers whispered, their gazes a mixture of awe and suspicion. Ashravan walked with renewed purpose, yet the memory of his betrayal, his weakness, gnawed at him.

A tremor ran through the city. Not of the earth, but of power. The Emperor, normally serene, stood rigid, eyes wide with a terror Ashravan had never witnessed. A dark, swirling cloud descended upon the palace, blotting out the sun. Whispers turned to screams.

From the cloud emerged a figure wreathed in shadow. Not a god, not a spren, but something else entirely. A creature of pure intent, ancient and malevolent. It spoke, its voice a chorus of despair: "The Forgery is an abomination. Order must be restored." Its gaze fell upon Ashravan.

Ashravan felt a pull, a compulsion to surrender, to allow the creature to unmake him, to return him to the nothingness from which he was formed. He fought against it, drawing strength from the very art that had saved him. He was a masterpiece, forged in defiance of fate. He would not break.

He drew his sword, its polished surface reflecting the encroaching darkness. The creature lunged. The battle for his soul, for the fate of the empire, had begun. He met the creature's assault, his blade a flickering beacon against the encroaching night. The clash of steel echoed through the collapsing palace. Ashravan knew, with chilling certainty, that this fight would decide everything.
